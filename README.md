# üè¶ Alemeno Backend Internship Assignment: Credit Approval System

This project implements a Credit Approval System backend using **Django 4+**, **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Celery/Redis** for asynchronous data ingestion.  
The entire application is containerized using Docker Compose.

---

## üöÄ Launch Services

Start all four services (DB, Redis, Web, Worker) in detached mode.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### üöÄ Verify Ingestion

Monitor the celery_worker logs to ensure the initial data is loaded into the database. This process starts automatically.

```bash
docker compose logs celery_worker
```

Look for the "Complete" messages for both Customer and Loan Data.
